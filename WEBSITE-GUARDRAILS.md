# WEBSITE & COPY GUARDRAILS (COMPREHENSIVE - WA COMPLIANT)

## Core Instruction

In this repository, always comply with WEBSITE-GUARDRAILS.md, README.md, and the latest SFM AI handoff files.

Treat Sankofa Family Medicine as membership-based primary care first and foremost.

Use "precision-informed" or "precision medicine-informed" only as a modifier, never as the primary identity. Precision tools are supportive and discretionary, applied based on clinical judgment.

Keep language virtual-only, Washington-only, non-DPC, self-pay, and physician-led.

Do not infer insurance billing, in-person care, emergency coverage, automated decision-making, or mandatory precision services.

If a suggestion would conflict with guardrails, omit it and flag the issue instead of guessing.

## Canonical Values (Hard-Coded)

The following values are canonical and must be used consistently across all website copy. Do not use alternative values, ranges, or derivations.

### Visit Duration
- **Canonical range: 40 to 60 minutes**
- Do not use "45 to 75 minutes," "45-75 minutes," or any other derivation
- If existing copy contains "45 to 75" or similar, it must be corrected to "40 to 60 minutes"
- This applies to all references to visit length, appointment duration, or consultation time

## Language Requirements

All content must be:
- **Virtual-only** - No references to in-person visits or physical office locations for care delivery
- **Washington-only** - Licensed and practicing in Washington State only (SC coming 2026)
- **Non-DPC** - Not direct primary care; this is concierge membership-based care
- **Self-pay** - Members pay membership fees directly; no insurance billing
- **Physician-led** - Dr. Nkrumah leads all clinical decisions; no automated medical decision-making

## Prohibited Inferences

Do **not** infer or suggest:
- Insurance billing or insurance acceptance
- In-person care or physical clinic visits for treatment
- Emergency coverage or after-hours emergency services
- Automated decision-making for clinical care
- Mandatory precision services (precision tools are discretionary based on clinical judgment)

## Conflict Resolution

If a suggestion would conflict with these guardrails, **omit it and flag the issue** instead of guessing or making assumptions.

When unsure, omit or ask rather than infer.
