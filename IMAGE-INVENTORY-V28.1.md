## TECHNICAL NOTES

### Image Optimization
After generating maps, optimize:
1. Export as PNG with transparency
2. Run through TinyPNG or ImageOptim
3. Target file size: <200KB per map
4. Provide @2x versions for retina: 2400x1600

### Alt Text Guidelines
- Descriptive but concise
- Include "Washington State" or "South Carolina" for SEO
- Mention "virtual primary care" or "service area" for context
- Example: "Map of Washington State showing Sankofa Family Medicine virtual primary care service areas"
