# GitHub Copilot Instructions (Sankofa Family Medicine)

You must treat the following file as authoritative for all public-facing language:

- /compliance/guardrails.public.md

## Mandatory behavior
1. Read /compliance/guardrails.public.md before proposing or editing any:
   - website copy
   - UI text
   - metadata (titles, descriptions, OpenGraph)
   - schema (JSON-LD, FAQ)
   - marketing snippets

2. If language is not explicitly authorized by the guardrails, omit it rather than infer it.

3. Do not soften, shorten, paraphrase, or rewrite disclaimers for tone.

4. Do not introduce:
   - DPC framing
   - insurance coverage implications
   - guarantees, superiority claims, outcomes promises
   - 24/7 access, instant access, real-time claims
   - in-person care implications
   - continuous monitoring implications
   - automated or AI-driven clinical decision claims

## Placement requirement
When you add copy, place it only in the appropriate file near the UI or metadata it governs.
If you add disclaimers, reuse canonical text and do not create new variants.

## Primary Identity

Treat Sankofa Family Medicine as **membership-based primary care** first and foremost.

Use "precision-informed" or "precision medicine-informed" **only as a modifier**, never as the primary identity. Precision tools are supportive and discretionary, applied based on clinical judgment.

## Language Requirements

Keep all language:
- **Virtual-only** — No references to in-person visits or physical office locations for care delivery
- **Washington-only** — Licensed and practicing in Washington State only (SC coming 2026)
- **Non-DPC** — Not direct primary care; this is concierge membership-based care
- **Self-pay** — Members pay membership fees directly; no insurance billing
- **Physician-led** — Dr. Nkrumah leads all clinical decisions; no automated medical decision-making

## Prohibited Inferences

Do **not** infer or suggest:
- Insurance billing or insurance acceptance
- In-person care or physical clinic visits for treatment
- Emergency coverage or after-hours emergency services
- Automated decision-making for clinical care
- Mandatory precision services (precision tools are discretionary based on clinical judgment)

## Conflict Resolution

If a suggestion would conflict with these guardrails, **omit it and flag the issue** instead of guessing or making assumptions.

When unsure, omit or ask rather than infer.
