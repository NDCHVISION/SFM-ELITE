# Copilot Instructions for Sankofa Family Medicine Repository

## Core Compliance

In this repository, always comply with `WEBSITE-GUARDRAILS.md`, `README.md`, and the latest SFM AI handoff files (currently V30).

## Primary Identity

Treat Sankofa Family Medicine as **membership-based primary care** first and foremost.

Use "precision-informed" or "precision medicine-informed" **only as a modifier**, never as the primary identity. Precision tools are supportive and discretionary, applied based on clinical judgment.

## Language Requirements

Keep all language:
- **Virtual-only** — No references to in-person visits or physical office locations for care delivery
- **Washington-only** — Licensed and practicing in Washington State only (SC coming 2026)
- **Non-DPC** — Not direct primary care; this is concierge membership-based care
- **Self-pay** — Members pay membership fees directly; no insurance billing
- **Physician-led** — Dr. Nkrumah leads all clinical decisions; no automated medical decision-making

## Prohibited Inferences

Do **not** infer or suggest:
- Insurance billing or insurance acceptance
- In-person care or physical clinic visits for treatment
- Emergency coverage or after-hours emergency services
- Automated decision-making for clinical care
- Mandatory precision services (precision tools are discretionary based on clinical judgment)

## Conflict Resolution

If a suggestion would conflict with these guardrails, **omit it and flag the issue** instead of guessing or making assumptions.

When unsure, omit or ask rather than infer.
