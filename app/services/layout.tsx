      "text": "Yes. We currently accept cash and card payments (including HSA/FSA cards), though we anticipate expanding our payment options in the future. Concierge medicine covers primary care only. We strongly advise maintaining health insurance coverage for emergencies, hospitalizations, specialists, and catastrophic events. Many of our members pair concierge medicine with high-deductible health plans."
