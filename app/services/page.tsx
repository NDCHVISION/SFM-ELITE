[UPDATE INSTRUCTION ONLY: Actual contents will replace the answer as specified below]

All instances of the FAQ answer for 'Do I still need health insurance?' in app/services/page.tsx should now be:

Yes. We currently accept cash and card payments (including HSA/FSA cards), though we anticipate expanding our payment options in the future. Concierge medicine covers primary care only. We strongly advise maintaining health insurance coverage for emergencies, hospitalizations, specialists, and catastrophic events. Many of our members pair concierge medicine with high-deductible health plans.

All other FAQ entries and unrelated content remain unchanged. The update was performed on the 'main' branch.
