# COPILOT SESSION PROMPT

## Purpose

This file contains the canonical prompt to paste into GitHub Copilot Chat at the start of each session when working in this repository. It ensures Copilot respects all compliance guardrails.

---

## Session Prompt (Copy and Paste)

```
In this repo, always comply with `WEBSITE & COPY GUARDRAILS (COMPREHENSIVE – WA COMPLIANT)` in `WEBSITE-GUARDRAILS.md` plus `README.md` and the latest SFM/AI/V30 handoff files. Keep all content virtual-only, WA-only, non-DPC, self-pay, concierge precision(-informed) primary care founded 2025, and follow all legal, temporal, emergency, enrollment, AI, and metadata guardrails. When unsure, omit or ask rather than infer.
```

## Usage Instructions

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code or GitHub.com
2. At the start of each new session or thread, paste the prompt above
3. Copilot will then apply the guardrails to all suggestions in that session
4. Re-paste at the start of each new session (prompts do not persist between sessions)

## Notes

- This prompt is designed to be short enough to paste quickly but comprehensive enough to enforce all critical rules
- If guardrails are updated, update this prompt accordingly
- Do not modify the prompt without reviewing `WEBSITE-GUARDRAILS.md` first
