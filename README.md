## Version 12.0 Elite

## Brand Voice

This website follows the Sankofa Family Medicine Voice, Tone, and Message Standard:

**Posture:** Quiet authority. Clinical calm. Ethical clarity. Human restraint.

**Feel:** Like a physician who is unhurried because the system behind them is sound.

**Language:** Declarative, not aspirational. Ethical, not emotional. Minimal adjectives.

**No:** Hype. Urgency theater. Startup language.

## Brand Standard Check

Before any copy goes live, it must answer yes to:

1. Does this sound calm under scrutiny?
2. Would this hold up in a clinical, legal, or ethical review?
3. Does this protect both the patient and the physician?
4. Is this memory, not marketing?
