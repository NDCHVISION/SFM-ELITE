## GOVERNING LEGAL FRAMEWORK (WASHINGTON)

All public-facing language must comply with, and be interpreted conservatively under, the following (non-exhaustive):
- RCW 18.130 - Uniform Disciplinary Act (professional conduct)
- RCW 48.150 - Direct Primary Care statute (avoid DPC characterization)
- RCW 19.86 - Washington Consumer Protection Act (no deceptive practices)
- RCW 62A.2-302 - Unconscionability (contract fairness)
- RCW 62A.2-718 - Liquidated damages (no punitive framing)
- Washington Medical Commission advertising guidance

# I. STRUCTURAL & JURISDICTIONAL GUARDRAILS

### Virtual-Only Care
- Care must be described as delivered virtually, via synchronous and asynchronous telehealth modalities, as clinically appropriate
- Do not use language that implies in-person visits, physical exams, walk-ins, or office appointments
- Do not use phrases such as:
  - "come into the office"
  - "in-clinic visit"
  - "walk-in"
- If physical examination is referenced, frame it as:
  - Virtual-appropriate (e.g., guided self-exam), or
  - Redirected to local in-person care

### Geographic Scope
- Active clinical care: Washington State only
- Anchor location: Spokane, Washington
- Patient location requirement: Care is provided only when the patient is physically located in Washington State at the time of the encounter
- Do not list South Carolina or any other state as an active care location
- South Carolina may be referenced only as a potential future jurisdiction (not active, no dates, no guarantees)
- Future expansion may be referenced only in non-committal, non-timed language (e.g., "may expand in the future")

### No Brick-and-Mortar Implication
- Do not list patient-facing addresses
- Any address shown must be clearly labeled "administrative address"
- Do not imply a physical location for care delivery

### No Timeline Commitments
- Do not publish specific launch dates, enrollment dates, or "coming in February" type language
- Use only non-committal phrasing such as "anticipated," "planned," or "may," and avoid month- or date-specific commitments

---

# II. ENROLLMENT, ELIGIBILITY & DISCRETION

### Physician Review Requirement
- Enrollment is always subject to physician review and clinical judgment
- Clinical appropriateness for virtual primary care is required
- The practice retains sole discretion to accept, decline, or discontinue care

### Right to Decline or Discontinue
Language must preserve the ability to:
- Decline enrollment if needs exceed scope
- Recommend in-person or specialty care based on clinical judgment
- Discontinue care when continuing would be unsafe or inappropriate

This must be framed neutrally and clinically, not as exclusionary or discriminatory.

### No Guarantee of Acceptance
- Waitlist != enrollment
- Interest != acceptance
- Membership availability is limited and discretionary

### Patient Responsibilities
- Patients are responsible for providing accurate information
- Patients are responsible for maintaining access to recommended care and following through on external referrals and testing, as clinically appropriate

---

# III. EMERGENCY & URGENCY GUARDRAILS

### Not an Emergency Service
- Public content must state that the practice does not provide emergency care
- Direct emergencies to 911 or the nearest emergency department

### No Replacement for Urgent Care
- Do not imply coverage for urgent or life-threatening conditions
- Do not use:
  - "always available"
  - "instant access"
  - "same-day for everyone"
  - "24/7 physician access"

### Response Time & Access Language
- Use: "typically," "intended," "generally," "aims to," "as clinically appropriate"
- Do not use: "guaranteed," "immediate," "real-time," "instant"
- Access language must be framed as enhanced availability within defined scope, not unlimited real-time physician access

### No Duty to Monitor
- Public language must clarify that the practice does not continuously monitor patient data, messages, wearables, or labs unless explicitly agreed upon in writing
- Do not imply ongoing real-time surveillance of health data

---

# IV. BILLING, INSURANCE & PAYMENT

### No Insurance Billing
- Public language must state the practice does not bill insurance
- Do not imply in-network status, "covered" services, or insurer payment for membership fees

### Out-of-Pocket Model
- All clinical services provided by the practice are self-pay
- External services (labs, imaging, medications, referrals) are paid separately by patients or processed through their own insurance, as clinically appropriate

### Superbills Language
- Superbills may be provided upon request when appropriate and at the practice's discretion
- Do not imply likelihood or expectation of reimbursement
- Use neutral phrasing such as "may be reimbursable depending on your plan"

### HSA/FSA Neutrality
- Use: "may be eligible depending on your plan"
- Do not promise HSA/FSA eligibility or reimbursement

### Pricing Flexibility
- Public language may state: "Membership structure and fees are subject to change and are communicated prior to enrollment"
- Do not imply long-term price guarantees

---

# V. MEMBERSHIP, PRICING & COMMITMENTS

- The practice model, staffing, and offerings may evolve over time in accordance with law and operational needs

---

# VI. SCOPE OF CARE

### Primary Care Scope
- Describe services as: virtual primary care, prevention, coordination, and longitudinal management, as clinically appropriate
- Primary care may include screening and coordination for mental health concerns
- Do not imply psychiatric specialty care, crisis services, or detox programs

### Continuity & Non-Guarantee
- Continuity of care is a guiding principle, not a contractual guarantee of duration, frequency, or availability
- Do not promise lifetime care, perpetual access, or permanent relationships

### No Outcome Guarantees
- Do not use: "cure," "reverse," "eliminate," "guarantee," "optimal results," "proven results," "fix"
- Use: "manage," "support," "aim to," "reduce risk," "help improve," "as clinically appropriate"

### Medication & Controlled Substances
- Prescribing is always "when clinically appropriate," "based on clinical judgment," or equivalent
- Do not make marketing promises regarding controlled substances, benzodiazepines, stimulants, or opioids
- Do not imply guaranteed prescribing, refills, or access to specific medications

### No Implied Specialty Programs
- Do not describe condition-specific "programs" (e.g., "diabetes reversal program," "weight loss program") unless formally defined, documented, and legally reviewed

---

# VII. GENETICS, LABS & ADVANCED TESTING

### Genetic Testing Framing
- Prefer "physician-led interpretation of genetic health information" or "genetic health interpretation," as clinically appropriate
- Use "interpretation" rather than "analysis" whenever possible

### No Brand Names Until BAAs Signed
- Do not name specific labs, platforms, or partners unless relationships and BAAs are finalized and documented
- Use generic descriptors only (e.g., "specialized lab partner," "CLIA-certified lab")

### No Predictive Claims
- Do not use deterministic or future-certain language such as "predict," "forecast your future health," "determine your future risk," "decide your destiny"
- Use probabilistic, contextual phrasing: "inform," "help understand risk," "support clinical decision-making," "provide additional context for your physician"

### Physician Judgment Supremacy
- All testing is ordered and interpreted at physician discretion
- Do not imply automated interpretation, self-service diagnostics, or AI-driven final decisions

---

# VIII. TECHNOLOGY, AI & DATA

### Understated Technology
- Do not emphasize AI, machine learning, or automation as drivers of clinical decisions
- Care must be positioned as physician-led, experience-based, and grounded in evidence and context
- "Concierge" may be used, but never with "VIP," "exclusive," "guaranteed access," or "priority emergency care"

### No Autonomous Systems
- Do not imply automated clinical decision-making
- Do not use phrases like "AI-powered care," "decision engine," or "automated triage" for clinical decisions

### AI as Support, Not Source
- If decision-support tools are referenced, describe them as advisory and not a replacement for physician judgment
- Example: "Any decision-support tools, when used, are advisory and do not replace physician judgment"

### HIPAA-Neutral & Privacy Promises
- Do not overclaim security (e.g., "unhackable," "military-grade," "zero-risk")
- Do not promise absolute confidentiality, anonymity, or that "no one will ever access your data"
- Use factual, bounded phrasing and defer specifics to the Privacy Policy and formal compliance documents

### No Training on Patient Data
- Public-facing content must not state or imply that patient data is used to train public or proprietary AI models
- If referenced, language should state: "Patient data is not used to train public or proprietary AI models"

### No Endorsements or Partner Claims
- Do not claim affiliation, endorsement, certification, or partnership with any third party unless formally documented and legally reviewed
- Do not use "partnered with [X]" or similar claims unless approved

---

# IX. OUTCOMES, MARKETING & CLAIMS

### No Guarantees or Superiority
- Do not use: "better outcomes," "best care," "most advanced," "better than other clinics," "superior to," "proven results"
- Differentiation must be descriptive (what we do), not comparative (better than others)

### Avoid Absolutes & Trigger Words
- Do not use absolutes like: "always," "never," "for everyone," "every time"
- Do not use high-risk words/phrases in a way that implies guarantees:
  - "guarantee," "cure," "prevent," "reverse," "optimal," "best," "proven," "results"
  - "same-day" (in a universal sense), "24/7," "instant," "real-time"
  - "covered," "in-network"

### Comparisons to Other Models
- Do not make comparison claims against concierge practices, DPC practices, insurers, or specific clinics
- Describe what this practice does without direct comparative framing

---

# X. PHYSICIAN & PRACTICE IDENTITY

### Single-Physician Transparency
- State that care is currently delivered by one physician
- It is acceptable to note that additional clinicians may be added in the future, without timelines or guarantees

### No Team Inflation
- Do not imply a large staff or multi-physician team when not accurate
- Use "the practice" or "your physician" carefully and accurately

---

# XI. COPY HYGIENE, EDUCATIONAL CONTENT & CONSISTENCY

### No Individualized Medical Advice
- Public website content is informational and educational only
- Do not write copy as individualized medical advice
- Do not use: "You should [do X] for your [condition]"
- Prefer: "In general...," "Many people...," "Options may include...," "Discuss with a clinician who knows your history"

### No Reliance as Medical Care
- Public-facing educational content is not intended to substitute for individualized medical evaluation, diagnosis, or treatment
- Do not invite or encourage reliance on public content as a substitute for direct clinical care

### Global De-Duplication & Canonical Disclaimers
Emergency, enrollment, and insurance disclaimers must:
- Either appear once in a clearly designated global section/component, or
- Be reused verbatim where repetition is required
- Maintain a single canonical disclaimer component or partial (e.g., `/components/Disclaimers.tsx` or `/content/disclaimers.md`) and reuse it verbatim

### Conflict Resolution
Before finalizing copy, check for internal contradictions:
- One section saying "we do not bill insurance" and another implying coverage
- One section implying 24/7 access and another describing limited hours
- Legal and clinical accuracy always overrides marketing tone or stylistic preferences

---

# XII. POSITIONING CLARITY

### Model & Positioning
- Position the practice as: "membership-based primary care, concierge in structure and precision-informed in approach"
- For extra conservatism, "membership-based primary care, concierge in structure and precision-informed" is acceptable language
- The practice is explicitly not DPC and not "direct primary care"
- Any legacy DPC language encountered must be corrected to align with this model

### Continuity & Memory Emphasis
- Emphasize continuity, longitudinal context, and memory-informed care as core pillars
- "Medicine That Remembers" is a care standard, not a marketing slogan or outcome claim

### Tier Language Consistency (Required)
Tier pages may differentiate by:
- Access cadence (channels available)
- Typical response time windows (never guaranteed)
- Visit length and depth
- Frequency and planning intensity

Tier pages must not differentiate by:
- Promising "better" medical care or outcomes at higher tiers
- Framing genetics/labs as "more precise" or "more accurate" at higher tiers
- Implying that physician judgment is replaced by technology at higher tiers

If response times are described by tier:
- Use "typical" or "intended" windows
- Include "as clinically appropriate"
- Avoid "guaranteed" or "always"

### Practice Evolution
- Public copy may state that the practice model, staffing, and offerings may evolve over time in accordance with law and operational needs
- Do not imply that any current configuration is permanent

---

# XIII. TESTIMONIALS, RANKINGS & SOCIAL PROOF (IF USED)

### Testimonials
- Testimonials must be genuine and not fabricated
- Do not incentivize testimonials in ways that could bias content
- Do not edit testimonials to change meaning or imply typical outcomes
- Do not allow testimonials to imply cures, guarantees, or "this fixed me" style language
- Testimonials must not imply that described experiences are typical for all patients

### Rankings, Awards & Badges
- Do not reference rankings, awards, "top doctor" badges, or third-party accolades unless independently verifiable and legally reviewed
- Do not imply official endorsement by third-party lists, magazines, or organizations without explicit documentation

---

# XIV. PRIORITY RULE (OVERRIDING)

**When in doubt:**
- Choose the most conservative, safety-first interpretation
- Clarity over cleverness
- Precision over persuasion
- Do not soften or weaken disclaimers for marketing tone
- If information is not explicitly authorized by this document or governing handoff files, omit it rather than infer or speculate
- If uncertain about legal, regulatory, billing, or scope implications, flag for human review rather than guessing
